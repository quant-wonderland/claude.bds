# Package a Python Module with Nix

Packaging a Python module (`buildPythonPackage`) involves determining the source, dependencies, and build system, typically from `pyproject.toml`. Ensure all dependencies are already packaged before referencing them.

More complex cases require special handling. Below are examples for different scenarios.

## Normal Python Module

See the simple example: [tyro](./tyro/package.nix)

## Customize Build System and Disable Tests

Some Python modules require additional build tools, or have tests that cannot run in the Nix sandbox. See [Swanboard](./swanboard/package.nix) for an example.

## Customize Source Root and Optional Dependencies

See [agno](./agno/package.nix) for examples of:

- Using `sourceRoot` when the Python module's root differs from the project root (specify the relative path).
- Handling optional dependencies: include them in `optional-dependencies` when available, or safely omit them if not yet packaged.

## Rust-Backed Python Module

For Python packages implemented in Rust with Python bindings, use `rustPlatform` as a helper. See [tantivy](./tantivy/package.nix) for an example.

## Relax or Remove Dependencies

When dependency requirements cannot be satisfied, investigate further:

1. **Version mismatch**: If the dependency is packaged but the version requirement is too strict, add it to `pythonRelaxDeps` to bypass version checking.
2. **Missing dependency**: If the dependency is not packaged, assess whether it's essential for your use case. If not, add it to `pythonRemoveDeps`.

See [darts](./darts/package.nix) for an example.
